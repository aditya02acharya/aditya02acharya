### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Researcher and Data Scientist, my work combines Data Analytics, Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to several projects in diverse areas and topics.

Skills:

- My preferred analytical language is Python. I'm currently exploring Go, mostly because i'm writing lot of backend web api's recently to interact with LLM's.  
- I use SQL, Polars and PySpark for data manipulation, React for dasboarding and data visualisation.
- Communication documents are written in Latex or Markdown.
