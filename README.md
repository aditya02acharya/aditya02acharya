### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Researcher and Data Scientist in human-computer interaction, specializing in agent-based cognitive modelling and decision making. Expert in machine learning, with a focus on reinforcement learning and deep learning, as applied to human-AI interaction and behavioural analytics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MARL based models for Human-Machine Teaming. I am also collaborating with a Health-Tech startup [Dexter](https://dexter.software/) to implement a Learning Health System.
